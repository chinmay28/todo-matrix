/**
 * The one place the app's version number is assembled.
 *
 * Scheme (shared with sand-vault): vYEAR.MONTH.PATCH — a calendar version,
 * where PATCH is the repository's commit count, so `v2026.8.311` is the 311th
 * commit on the 2026.8 line. The month is not zero-padded; that keeps the
 * string valid semver.
 *
 *   - YEAR/MONTH are the constants below — the single declaration in the
 *     tree. Bump them here when a release line opens; they are not taken from
 *     the build clock, which would move the version without a commit.
 *   - PATCH comes from `git rev-list --count HEAD`, which only exists at
 *     build time: Vite inlines it into the bundle via `define`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/version.mjs            # print e.g. v2026.8.311
 *   node scripts/version.mjs --patch    # print just the commit count (311)
 *   import { appVersion } from './scripts/version.mjs'

 *
 * Shallow is the trap, and it's why this isn't a bare `rev-list`: a clone
 * made with `--depth 1` answers `rev-list --count HEAD` with `1`, which is
 * not an error and not obviously wrong — it just quietly ships a build
 * calling itself `2026.8.1`. Refuse it. Patch 0 is the agreed "unstamped
 * build" marker, and a version ending in `.0` is visibly a non-release
 * rather than a plausible lie.
 *
 * Anything building a release therefore needs the full commit graph:
 * `fetch-depth: 0` on GitHub Actions, `--filter=blob:none` rather than
 * `--depth 1` for a cheap clone that still carries all of it.
